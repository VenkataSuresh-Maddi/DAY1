#DESCEIBING THE PROBLEM
def my_function():
    for i in range(1, 20):  # Looping from 1 to 19 (range is exclusive of 20)
        if i == 20:  # This condition will never be met, because the loop stops at 19
            print("You got it")


my_function()

# 1. What is the for loop doing?
#    - It loops from 1 to 19, incrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.
# 
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
#    - It is supposed to print "You got it" when `i` equals 20.
#
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
#    - The assumption might be that `i` would reach 20, but `range(1, 20)` only goes up to 19.
#
# üîß FIX:
#    - Change `range(1, 21)` so that `i` reaches 20.
